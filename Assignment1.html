//the + operator concats the given numbers considering them as strings
//Output : 122
console.log(1 + "2"+ "2");

//the first + is considered as an operator
//the second + operator before 2 converts string "2" as number 2
//so 1+2 becomes 3 and the string "2" has only one + operator so it is concatenated to 3
//Output : 32
console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");

//Output : 02
console.log(1 +-"1" + "2");

//the first + operator converts string "1" to number type 1
//but the + operator concats the strings 
//Output : 112
console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");

//the - operator performs operations on only numbers
//if the operation is performed on strings it returns NaN
//the + operator concats NaN and string "2"
//Output : NaN2
console.log("A" - "B" + "2");

//the - operator performs operations on only numbers
//if the operation is performed on strings it returns NaN
//NaN and number 2 cannot be added so
//Output : NaN
console.log("A" - "B" + 2);
